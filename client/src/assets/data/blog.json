At Taylor View Dental in Idaho Falls, we care about your smile. We have put together some handy tips on taking care of your teeth and mouth, naturally. Why is oral hygiene so important? The state of your mouth has a much greater impact on your body's health than just your smile. Gum disease can result from the accumulation of plaque on the gum line, potentially causing tooth decay, tooth loss, and infection in your mouth. As your mouth is the door to your body, other conditions that can result in poor oral hygiene include: Cancer Infective Endocarditis Bacterial Pneumonia Pregnancy Complications including low birth weight Sepsis How to keep your teeth and gums healthy? We all know that brushing your teeth twice a day, regular flossing and regular dental checkups are tried and tested ways to help maintain good oral hygiene but are there other methods to keep our mouths healthy? Food You won't be surprised to discover that the food we eat has a big impact on the health of our teeth and gums. Certain foods can be added to your daily diet which supports healthy bacteria levels within your mouth. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends we add more grains,cereals, dairy, and low-fat protein to our diets. They go on to recommend chewing hard, fibrous and watery fruit and vegetables to both remove food from our teeth and encourage the production of saliva. The ADA also recommends limiting your daily snack intake as these foods tend to beon the sugary side. When you eat sugar, the bacteria in your mouth will love you, and that's not a good thing. They feed off the sugar which converts to acid and gradually damages your teeth. Try snacking on nuts, fruit, or cheese."

    "btitle": "What Exactly Is a Root Canal?",
    "bdesc": "If you have put up with tooth sensitivity for days on end, your dentist may prescribe a root canal to eliminate the problem. However, do not be anxious, as the procedure is highly effective and you should go back to enjoying your favorite foods and smiling in no time. A root canal is a treatment used by specialists to repair and save teeth that are severely decayed or infected. The procedure will eliminate bacteria from the canal of an infected tooth and prevent its re-infection. Why Do I Need A Root Canal? You should not have to worry if your dentist prescribes a root canal for you. It is a serious procedure that should only be carried out by a qualified dentist or endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist that specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of injuries and diseases of the dental pulp or nerve of the tooth. You may need a root canal in case a previous filling has complications or you have a chipped tooth. A tooth’s nerve and canal can become inflamed and irritated due to severe decay, large fillings, repeated dental procedures on one tooth, or trauma to the face. Your dentist may also recommend one if your teeth are extremely sensitive to hot and cold sensations, like when you take hot coffee or eat ice cream. Other symptoms that may necessitate a root canal include: • Severe pain upon biting or chewing food • Irritation and pimples on the gums • Tender or swollen gums • Darkening of the gums • Lingering sensitivity to hot or cold sensations even after removing the beverage or food causing the discomfort When your tooth’s nerve tissue and pulp are damaged and exposed, they start to decay, and bacteria multiply quickly in the area. Without adequate treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected, forming an abscess. Root canals are procedures that specialists carry out every day to save millions of patients from severe toothache and tooth decay. Over 95% of people who undergo a root canal experience success, with teeth treated using this procedure lasting a lifetime. Other benefits of choosing to save your natural tooth via root canal include: • Better chewing efficiency • Natural teeth appearance • Protects surrounding teeth from excess wear and tear • Eliminates discomfort from consumption of hot and cold foods and beverages • Normal bite force"

    "btitle": "How Dental Implants Work?",
    "bdesc": "The Procedure And How Dental Implants Work If you are missing one or more teeth, you might consider asking your dentist if you are a candidate for dental implants Idaho Falls. Especially if you would prefer not to have a bridge or full or partial dentures. Dental implants are more common than dentures since they are permanent teeth that are directly attached to the jawbone. To take advantage of dental implants, you must be in good health (aside from missing teeth) and have a well-developed and stable jawbone. What Do Dental Implants Look Like? Dental implants are more similar than prostheses to natural teeth. A dental implant looks like a cylinder or screw, and it is an artificial substitute for a missing tooth's root. Implants are made of titanium or other material which does not adversely affect the jawbone and gum tissue implants. Procedure Of Dental Implants If your dentist decides that you are a suitable candidate for implants, he or she will arrange the operation. Based on dental health requirements and the amount of surgery needed, this will be performed either at the dentist's office with local anesthesia or at a hospital with general anesthesias. How Long Does The Procedure Of Dental Implants Idaho Falls Take? Note that the dental implant operation takes many hours and can require many procedures. Therefore, someone at elevated risk for infection should consider whether of not this procedure is right for them. If you undergo dental surgery, follow your dentist's grooming guidelines – including brushing and flossing twice daily – to keep your teeth healthy and clean. The benefits of dental implants versus prosthesis include a more natural way to eat and speak, and dental repairs are not necessary. Nevertheless, it is essential to see a dentist regularly to ensure the good health of your implants and to adopt a daily oral routine of brushing the tooth and flossing twice a day. Should I Get Dental Implants In Idaho Falls Done? Dental implants may not be the right choice for everyone. Pregnant women or individuals with chronic disease or immunosuppression, children (because their jawbones continue to develop), and those who grind or clench teeth (which may put too much pressure on implants in this habit) are not good candidates for tooth implants. What To Expect After The Implants Are Done? You may have bleeding, discomfort, and swelling of the gums and face after either of the minor operations. After the procedure, you will want to eat soft foods to allow the dental implant time to heal. What Happens In A Dental Implant Idaho Falls? Generally, a dental implant is performed over a few months in stages, with several minor procedures and exams. To give the dentist an incredibly clear image where the implant should be mounted, you need scans and x-rays. The dental implant can be inserted into the jawbone with a small operation. Anesthesia is usually provided to keep you from feeling pain during the operation. You wait a few months for the dental implant to fully attach to the bone. Your dentist will build a base for your new tooth so the implant stays secure. Implants For Children? Young children cannot obtain a dental implant until the jaw grows and develops entirely. After Your Procedure You will feel slightly rugged for several hours if your dentist is in IV sedation. Make sure that after the procedure, you get someone to drive you home. You may suffer from bruising, swelling, minor bleeding, and pain after the implants are placed. During the healing process, you may be advised to take soft foods, cold food, and warm soup. Your dentist is likely to recommend drugs on standby, like Advil (ibuprofen), to help with any discomfort. Dental Implants In Idaho Falls Talk to your dentist if you are interested in getting an implant. Depending on the layout of your mouth, and your health, the time involved can vary from person to person. Your dentist will be able to let you know if you are a good candidate for the procedure."

    "btitle": "How your eating habits affect your dental health?",
    "bdesc": "Did you know that some foods that are considered beneficial to our body can turn out to be detrimental to your long-term dental health? It's paramount to be mindful of what you consume to ensure you enjoy a healthy smile for more years to come. Your eating habits are directly proportional to your general health and also the health of your teeth and gums. Whatever you consume has an instrumental impact on the health of your mouth, teeth, and gums. Chewing and swallowing are the primary stages of the extensive journey through your digestive system. The nutrients you take come into contact first with your mouth, significantly impacting your oral health. Many foods on the standard American diet constitute sugary, processed foods and highly acidic beverages, leading to wearing out of your tooth enamel, thereby propagating cavities. Therefore, it's paramount to focus on consuming healthy foods that assist in the promotion of oral health. Nutritional counseling in dental practice advocates the importance of nutrition in dentistry as a vital component of improving or safeguarding oral health. Focusing on eating a balanced diet will boost your intake of tooth-friendly nutrients like calcium. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet, including safe drinking, suppresses your risk of enamel erosion and cavities, preserving your smile looking more nourishing and longer. Keep reading to keep yourself abreast on dos and don'ts for maintaining prolific dental health. Foods that affect your dental health Sugary foods Confectionaries like chewing gum, candy, suckers, and gummies are clear triggers. Did you know that even fruit juices, energy drinks, and sports drinks usually constitute refined sugar too? Sugary substances get stuck on your teeth and aggravate tooth decay-a state that can transform to more severe levels for those struggling with an improper diet. It's paramount to steer away from soft and sweet foods that stick to your teeth, like candy and cake. Carbonated drinks These are the leading sources of excess sugar in the kids and teen diet. Soda and energy drinks aren't good for teeth because they contain high sugar content. Several of these manufactured beverages are comprised of phosphoric and citric acids, which erode the tooth enamel. Starchy foods Starchy foods get stuck to and in between the teeth. Food that consists of high levels of carbohydrates acts like sugar, therefore, impacting your oral health. Citrus Wine, fruits, and juices generally contain acids. Though consumption of these drinks isn't considered unhealthy, exposure of your teeth to the high amount of acids erodes your tooth enamel over time. This erosion makes it more susceptible to the development of cavities and decay. Hard foods Cutting down on extra hard food can avert the cases of teeth breakage. Chewing things like hard candies and nuts is one of the leading causes of this prevailing dental emergency. Caffeinated foods and drinks Caffeine propagates several negative impacts on your dental health, including stained teeth and causing a dry mouth. Caffeine is consumed chiefly with sugar, which promotes teeth decay. Drinks like coffee, tea, and sweets contain caffeine. Alcohol Regular drinking can culminate into a dry mouth, which amplifies the risk for oral infections and gum ailments. Excessive alcohol consumption heightens the risk of contracting oral cancer."

    "btitle": "What Precautions to Take After Tooth Filling?",
    "bdesc": "Cavities are a common dental issue for both kids and adults globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90% of adults aged 20 years and above have had a cavity. Unfortunately, if cavities are not treated, they could lead to a fatal infection under the gums. The infection can also reach other parts of the body, and though in rare cases, the infection can be fatal. The most common cavity treatment apart from tooth extraction is tooth filling. Sometimes some patients experience sensitivity after a tooth filling. However, this is not a major issue and can easily be solved by following the after-care instructions recommended by a dentist. Let’s look at some basic precautions after composite filling: Precautions After Composite Filling Below are precautions you should take after a tooth filling: Be Extra Cautious Your dentist might have told you how long the local anesthesia will take to wear off. It usually wears off within 1-3 hours. You need to be extra cautious with your whole mouth during this time. When the side of your mouth where you had a filling is still numb, it will be impossible to feel pain. Therefore you might accidentally bite your lips, tongue, or cheeks. Therefore, you should stay off food until the anesthesia finally wears off- don’t worry, it usually doesn’t take long. Also, if you notice that the numbness is taking longer than the dentist said, be sure to contact them as soon as possible. Avoid Smoking If you love smoking, this is the best time to quit smoking until you are completely healed. If you smoke while a part of your mouth is still numb, you might accidentally hurt yourself. Smoking immediately after a tooth filling might result in an infection. Smoking weakens your immunity, so it is very easy for you to get an infection. Consider a Dental Routine Consider having your dental routine at home. Let it be rigid, and don’t skip it. Oral hygiene is essential at this point. The routine should include; Brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste after a healed filling. Flossing regularly Swishing your mouth once a day Never missing your dental checkups Eating After a Filling Choosing what to eat after a filling is essential. However, eating after a filling can be quite a challenge. You need to be extra careful about the food you eat. Some tooth filling will not immediately attach to the tooth, so you need to take extra precautions after composite filling. It is common to experience pain while chewing with the tooth that recently got a filing. You need to be conscious of every bite you take. Bite carefully or consider eating softer foods. You may feel some impacts, such as having some difficulty choosing what to eat after getting a filling. For example, you will need to avoid too hot or too cold food. Also, do away with foods that require a hard biting such as meat, apples, or carrots. Finally, to avoid infection, avoid acidic foods. The plus side is that you do not have to wait to floss your teeth. The pain or sensitivity surrounding the affected tooth may disappear after a few days to a few weeks. However, if you are worried that it is taking too long, be sure to contact your doctor. What Influences The Precautions After Composite Filling? Other than watching what and how you eat, other variables may influence the precautions after composite filling. These factors include: Anesthesia The local anesthesia that your dentist uses to numb your gums may determine how long you will need to stay away from certain foods. Postoperative Discomfort It is common and normal to have discomfort after a tooth filling. The discomfort sometimes may affect your appetite or even your desire to eat. Your dentist may recommend some over-the-counter painkillers to help you remedy the discomfort. Gum Tissue Soreness Tooth filling may irritate the gum around the affected tooth, causing soreness. This is a factor that will affect the precautions after composite filling. You will need to rinse your mouth with warm salt water to make you feel better. Sensitivity Sensitivity may also affect the precautions after composite filling. For example, your dentist may recommend that you avoid too hot or cold foods for one or two weeks."
