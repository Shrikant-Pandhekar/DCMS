      "The bright white of your teeth can change due to several factors. Food, drink, tobacco use, age, and even some medications can cause your teeth to become yellowed over time and cause a loss of original whiteness to your teeth. Teeth whitening is a simple process whereby whiteners are used to break stains into smaller pieces so that they aren't as noticeable. We use peroxide bleach gel which is refrigerated to prevent breakdown and give the best clean for the brightest smile possible.",
    tquestion2: "Do I Need It?",
    tans2:
      "If you find you're smiling less because you're self-conscious about the color of your teeth then you may want to think about a tooth whitening system. Perhaps you recently quit smoking and you want to remove all remnants of that habit, a tooth whitening can help you move on. Overuse of teeth whiteners can cause sensitivity to the teeth and gums and even some damage if the whitener is used for too long. We'll help you choose the treatment that's best for you.",
